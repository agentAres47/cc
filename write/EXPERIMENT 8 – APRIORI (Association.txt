EXPERIMENT 8 – APRIORI (Association Rule Mining)

Experiment no 8 DM

Aim:

To implement Apriori algorithm using WEKA.

Theory:

Apriori discovers frequent itemsets and builds association rules.
It works level-wise by generating candidate sets and pruning those with low support.
Important concepts:

Support: Frequency of an itemset

Confidence: Strength of rule

Lift: Measure of dependency

Used in market basket analysis to find relationships like:
“If a user buys item A, they are likely to buy item B.”

Procedure:

Load test.arff into WEKA.

Click Associate tab.

Choose Apriori (default).

Adjust support/confidence if needed.

Run to generate rules.

Output:

Association rules like:
AdmissionYear=2005 → Course=CSE (support=..., confidence=...)

Conclusion:

Apriori generated meaningful rules showing hidden relationships in the dataset.
