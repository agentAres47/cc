 EXPERIMENT 6 – K-Means Clustering

Experiment No 6

Aim:

To implement K-means clustering.

Theory:

K-means is an unsupervised algorithm that groups data into k clusters based on similarity.
Process:

Choose k initial centroids.

Assign each point to the nearest centroid.

Recompute centroids.

Repeat until convergence.

Clustering is useful in segmentation, pattern discovery, and anomaly detection. It aims to minimize intra-cluster distance and maximize inter-cluster separation.

Procedure:

Load dataset in WEKA → Cluster tab.

Choose SimpleKMeans.

Set number of clusters k.

Run clustering.

View assignments and centroids.

Output:

Cluster memberships and updated centroid values.

Conclusion:

K-means successfully grouped similar items into meaningful clusters.
