EXPERIMENT 2 – Dimension Tables & Fact Tables Implementation

Experiment No. 2 DM

Aim:

To create and implement all dimension tables and fact tables for the given case study.

Theory:

A data warehouse stores large historical data for analysis. It uses a dimensional model, which includes:

1. Dimension Tables

These are descriptive tables that answer “how, what, where, when, who.”
Example dimensions:

Time Dimension → day, month, year

Product Dimension → item name, brand, category

Customer Dimension → customer details

Branch Dimension → store location

A dimension table:

Contains textual/ descriptive attributes

Has a surrogate primary key

Is referenced by fact tables

2. Fact Tables

A fact table stores:

Measurements / facts (e.g., quantity, profit, sales amount)

Foreign keys to dimension tables

It represents a business event (like a sale).
Example fields: customer_id, item_id, branch_id, time_id, qty, profit.

Purpose of Dimensional Modeling:

Speeds up analytical queries

Simplifies reporting

Organizes data into an easy-to-understand star schema

Supports OLAP operations (roll-up, drill-down)

This experiment implements both OLTP tables and then creates corresponding dimension and fact tables to form a data mart.

Procedure:

Create OLTP tables:

CUSTOMER

ITEM

TRANS

ITEM_SOLD

BRANCH

Insert sample data using SQL INSERT commands.

Create dimension tables using CREATE TABLE statements:

Customer Dimension

Item Dimension

Branch Dimension

Time Dimension

Create FACT TABLE (Sales_Fact) that references all dimensions.

Insert transaction data into the fact table.

Output:

Dimension tables (Customer, Item, Branch, Time) created successfully.

Fact table (Sales_Fact) created and linked using foreign keys.

Complete star schema for the case study.

Conclusion:

Dimension and fact tables were successfully implemented, forming a functional data mart that supports analytical operations in a data warehouse.
