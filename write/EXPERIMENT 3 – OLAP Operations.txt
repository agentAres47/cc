EXPERIMENT 3 – OLAP Operations in SQL


Aim:

To implement OLAP operations in SQL for the given case study.

Theory:

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) allows managers and analysts to view data in multiple perspectives for decision-making. It operates on multidimensional data represented through cubes.

OLAP supports fast and interactive analysis using operations like:

1. Roll-Up (Drill-Up)

Moves from detailed data to higher-level summary

Example: Product → Category → Total Sales

2. Drill-Down (Roll-Down)

Opposite of roll-up

Moves from summary to detailed level

3. Slice

Selects one specific value of a dimension

Example: Viewing only sales for “2024”

4. Dice

Filters on multiple dimensions

Example: Sales for (Region = North AND Year = 2023)

5. Pivot (Rotate)

Reorients the multidimensional cube for better visualization

Converts rows → columns or vice versa

6. Drill Across / Drill Through

Drill Across → Uses more than one fact table

Drill Through → Moves from cube to raw relational tables

SQL enables OLAP operations using:

GROUP BY

ROLLUP

CUBE

GROUPING SETS

These allow generation of subtotals, grand totals, and multidimensional summaries.

Output:

Roll-up generated hierarchical summaries (Region → Region totals → Grand Total).

Cube generated all possible combinations and totals.

Grouping sets returned customized totals.

Slice and dice filtered the data.

Drill-down showed detailed entries.

Conclusion:

OLAP operations were successfully executed in SQL, demonstrating multidimensional data analysis such as summarization, filtering, and hierarchical exploration.
