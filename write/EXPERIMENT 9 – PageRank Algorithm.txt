EXPERIMENT 9 – PageRank Algorithm

Experiment No 9

Aim:

To implement and analyze PageRank using WEKA or external computation.

Theory:

PageRank measures importance of web pages based on incoming links.
If a page is linked by important pages, its rank increases.
Formula uses:

Damping factor (0.85)

Teleportation probability

Outgoing link distribution

Applications: search engines, network analysis, ranking systems.

Procedure:

Create edges.arff containing directed links.

Load into WEKA Preprocess tab.

Apply PageRank filter OR compute externally using Python NetworkX.

View PageRank scores for each node.

Output:

Example:
C = 0.38, A = 0.33, B = 0.18, D = 0.11.

Conclusion:

PageRank successfully ranked nodes based on link structure and importance.
