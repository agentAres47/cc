EXPERIMENT 7 – Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

Experiment 7 DM

Aim:

To demonstrate Agglomerative Clustering using WEKA.

Theory:

Hierarchical clustering builds clusters step-by-step.
Agglomerative = bottom-up → each point starts as individual cluster → close clusters are merged repeatedly.
It uses distance metrics like Euclidean distance.
The output is visualized through a dendrogram, showing how clusters merge at each level.
This method is useful when the number of clusters is unknown beforehand.

Procedure:

Convert dataset to ARFF format.

Load in WEKA → Cluster tab.

Choose HierarchicalClusterer.

Set linkage/parameters.

Click Start to generate dendrogram.

Output:

Hierarchical cluster structure showing merging order.

Conclusion:

Agglomerative clustering successfully formed a natural hierarchy of clusters.
